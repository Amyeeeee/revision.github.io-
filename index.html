    <div id="style">
        A new English teacher, John Keating <span class="color">(Robin Williams)</span>, is introduced to an all-boys
        preparatory school that is
        known for its ancient traditions and high standards. He uses unorthodox methods to reach out to his students,
        who face enormous pressures from their parents and the school. With Keating's help, students Neil Perry<span
            class="color">(Robert
            Sean Leonard)</span> , Todd Anderson<span class="color">(Ethan Hawke)</span> and others learn to break out
        of their shells, pursue their dreams
        and seize the day.

    <h2 class="color">The main message that can be taken from the movie is:</h2><br>
    <div id="style">
        Reading and writing were portrayed as integral to the human experience and rather than putting it at odds with
        math and science, Keating insists that all are noble pursuits; that science is necessary to sustain life but
        poetry is what we stay alive for.
